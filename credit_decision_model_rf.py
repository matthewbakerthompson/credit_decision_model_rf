Description:
    This script trains and evaluates a machine learning model to recommend credit card 
    products and credit limits based on a customer's financial profile. The model uses 
    a synthetic dataset generated from customer credit attributes like credit score, 
    income, debt, and payment history to make product recommendations.

    The dataset includes variables that are essential for credit risk modeling, such as 
    Debt-to-Income (DTI) ratio, existing debt, employment status, and credit utilization. 
    The model uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict which credit product (e.g., 
    Basic, Standard, Gold, or Platinum Card) a customer is eligible for based on their 
    creditworthiness, and it provides a recommended credit limit based on that product.

Features:
    - Trains a machine learning model (Random Forest) to classify customers into one of 
      four credit card product categories: Basic, Standard, Gold, or Platinum.
    - Recommends a credit limit based on the customer's predicted credit product and income.
    - Includes hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
    - Outputs accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix for the modelâ€™s 
      performance on the test set.
    - Provides feature importance to explain the impact of different variables on the 
      model's decision-making process.
    - Handles the preprocessing of categorical and numerical data, including encoding 
      categorical variables and scaling numeric features.

Inputs:
    - enhanced_credit_risk_data.csv: The generated dataset containing customer credit 
      information used to train and test the model.

Outputs:
    - Model evaluation metrics, including confusion matrix and classification report 
      printed to the console.
    - Feature importance metrics printed to the console to interpret model decisions.
    - Recommended credit product and credit limit for test customers printed to the console.

Usage:
    python credit_decision_model.py

Dependencies:
    - pandas
    - numpy
    - sklearn (RandomForestClassifier, GridSearchCV, train_test_split, StandardScaler, LabelEncoder)
    - matplotlib (optional, for visualizing results)
    - enhanced_credit_risk_data.csv (generated from the synthetic data generation script)

Model Governance Features:
    - Hyperparameter tuning is performed using GridSearchCV to avoid overfitting and to 
      optimize model parameters.
    - Feature importance is evaluated to ensure model transparency and interpretability.
    - The model can be validated using holdout data (test set) to ensure generalization.
    - Key performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score) are printed for 
      each credit product class to track model effectiveness.
