# credit_decision_model_rf
    This script trains and evaluates a machine learning model to recommend credit card      products and credit limits based on a customer's financial profile. The model uses      a synthetic dataset generated from customer credit attributes like credit score,      income, debt, and payment history to make product recommendations.
